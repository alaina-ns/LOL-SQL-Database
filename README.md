# LOL-SQL-Database
I've been playing league of legends for about 10 years and still enjoy the game today. I wanted to practice my SQL skills so I chose something that I enjoy doing. All data was hand scrapped using Python and imported into a Excel file.
This allowed me to use the excel file to import into the SQL server.
This Project is still a work in progress. I plan to add more tables and provide detail analytics about the champions.
