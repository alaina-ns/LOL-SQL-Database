# LOL-SQL-Database
I've been playing League of Legends for about 10 years and still enjoy the game today. I wanted to practice my SQL skills so I chose something that I enjoy doing. All data was scrapped using Python and imported into an Excel file.
This allowed me to use the Excel file to import into the SQL server.
This Project is still a work in progress. I plan to add more tables and provide detailed analytics about the champions.

The PDF demonstrates some queries I did to acquire, delete or add data.
